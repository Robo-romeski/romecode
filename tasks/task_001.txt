# Task ID: 1
# Title: Fix Our Expertise Section Desktop/Mobile Overlap
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Both desktop and mobile carousels are visible simultaneously on tablet viewports (showing 12 cards instead of 6)
# Details:
Update desktop version classes from hidden lg:block to remain as is. Update mobile version to use lg:hidden properly. Add tablet-specific carousel with hidden md:block lg:hidden showing 2-3 cards. Test at 768px, 820px, and 1024px breakpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test on iPad devices at 768x1024, 820x1180, and 1024x1366 viewports. Verify only one carousel shows and correct number of cards are visible.

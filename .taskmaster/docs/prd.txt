Product Requirements Document: RomeCode Website iPad Layout Fixes

Project Overview:
The RomeCode website currently has responsive design issues on iPad and tablet devices (768px-1024px viewports). This project aims to fix layout problems, overlapping sections, and optimize the user experience specifically for tablet users.

Tech Stack:
- React with TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Deployed on AWS S3 + CloudFront

Current Issues:
1. Our Expertise section shows both desktop and mobile carousels simultaneously on tablets
2. Hero section uses mobile background image with poor spacing on iPad
3. Why Choose Us grid is too cramped in 2x2 layout on portrait iPads
4. Cloud Technology section image takes disproportionate space on tablets
5. Navigation arrows go off-screen due to negative margins
6. Footer 4-column layout is cramped on iPad portrait
7. No tablet-specific spacing or breakpoints implemented

Project Goals:
1. Fix all overlapping and duplicate content issues
2. Implement proper tablet breakpoints (md: 768px-1023px)
3. Optimize layouts specifically for iPad portrait and landscape modes
4. Ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable
5. Maintain visual hierarchy across all tablet viewports
6. Create consistent spacing system for tablets

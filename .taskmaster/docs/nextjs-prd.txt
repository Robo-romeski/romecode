Product Requirements Document: RomeCode Next.js Migration

Project Overview:
Migrate the existing RomeCode website from React/Vite SPA to Next.js 14+ with App Router for improved SEO, performance, and server-side rendering capabilities. The migration should maintain all current functionality while adding new features and optimizations.

Current Tech Stack:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- Tailwind CSS
- PWA capabilities
- Deployed on AWS S3 + CloudFront

Target Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Image optimization
- API routes
- Deployed on Vercel or AWS Amplify

Key Requirements:

1. Setup & Configuration:
   - Create new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
   - Configure development environment and deployment pipeline
   - Set up proper project structure following Next.js conventions
   - Configure security headers and optimizations

2. Component Migration:
   - Convert all components to Next.js App Router structure
   - Implement Server Components by default
   - Use Client Components only where interactivity is needed
   - Maintain responsive design across all breakpoints

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement Next.js Image optimization for all images
   - Use next/font for font optimization
   - Configure proper caching strategies
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)

4. SEO Enhancement:
   - Implement metadata API for all pages
   - Create dynamic sitemap generation
   - Add structured data (JSON-LD)
   - Configure proper meta tags and OG images

5. PWA Features:
   - Maintain existing PWA capabilities
   - Configure next-pwa plugin
   - Implement offline functionality
   - Keep install prompt feature

6. API Integration:

   - Implement email notifications
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Configure rate limiting

7. Testing & Quality:
   - Set up comprehensive testing suite
   - Implement E2E tests with Playwright
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitor performance metrics

8. Deployment Strategy:
   - Zero-downtime migration
   - Gradual rollout with feature flags
   - Proper redirects from old URLs
   - Monitoring and rollback plan

Success Criteria:
- Lighthouse scores > 95 on all metrics
- Improved SEO rankings
- Faster page load times
- Maintained or improved user experience
- No broken functionality
- Proper mobile responsiveness

Constraints:
- Maintain current design and branding
- Keep all existing features functional
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Complete migration within 8 weeks
- Minimize downtime during deployment

Priority Features:
1. Server-side rendering for better SEO
2. Image optimization
3. Performance improvements
4. API routes for contact form
5. Enhanced PWA capabilities
6. Analytics and monitoring

Migration Phases:
Phase 1: Setup and planning (Week 1-2)
Phase 2: Component migration (Week 3-4)
Phase 3: Features and optimization (Week 5-6)
Phase 4: PWA and advanced features (Week 7)
Phase 5: Testing and deployment (Week 8)

Risk Mitigation:
